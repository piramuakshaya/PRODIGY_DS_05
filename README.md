## Introduction
The Road Safety Analysis project aims to analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. 
The dataset used for this analysis is the "Bangalore Road Accidents" dataset.

## Data Preprocessing
In data preprocessing , I cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis. This involved encoding categorical variables, and performing feature engineering.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The exploratory data analysis explores the dataset to gain insights into accident patterns. Visualizations and statistical analysis are used to highlight interesting trends and patterns.

## Geospatial Analysis
Geospatial analysis identifies accident hotspots on a map using clustering algorithms. The KMeans algorithm is applied to find areas with higher concentrations of accidents.

## Time Analysis
The time analysis notebook investigates patterns related to the time of day, day of the week, and month. Time series plots and visualizations provide insights into accident occurrences over time.

## Correlation Analysis
Correlation analysis quantifies the relationships between different variables, such as road conditions, weather, and accident frequency. The correlation matrix heatmap illustrates the strength and direction of these relationships.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project provides valuable insights into road safety patterns in Bangalore based on comprehensive data analysis. The findings can inform stakeholders and policymakers to enhance road safety measures.
